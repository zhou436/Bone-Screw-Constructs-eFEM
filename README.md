The code was generate for voxel-to-element mesh, especially for screw bone construct stability evaluation. We provided several example data. To access more, please search

Acknowledegement
Some of the ideas of early versions were generate from: Jiexian Ma (2023). voxelMesh (voxel-based mesh) (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/104720-voxelmesh-voxel-based-mesh), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved December 13, 2023.
Thanks to his contribution, mainly in the voxel to element part. The code was later optimized by converting loop to matrix calculation. It requires more memory, but more efficient by large model generation.
